# Dataproject ATP Tennis

For this project, we have chosen to analyze data from the ATP Tennis Organization from 2015. We have chosen to analyze tennis data based on common group interest and to take advantage of the free guideline to spice an economical project up.  The aim of our project has been to examine the world’s best male tennis player and figure out who is most likely to become a part of this league. 

We have merged and cleaned the data by for instance removing empty cells and get rid of outliers. This has made it possible for us to make more or less precise conclusions through our project. We have created tables, graphs, and a heatmap to help us get a better understanding of the world’s best players in 2015.
