# The Augmented Solow Model with Human Capital
For our model project, we have chosen to examine the expanded Solow growth model. The Solow growth model focuses on long-run economic
growth. In part 1 we start by looking at a Solow model with human capital per effective worker where we solve for steady-state value analytically and numerically. Furthermore, we construct an interactive phase diagram where we can see the steady-state value for different parameter values. 

# The Augmented Solow Model with Human Capital and Natural Resources 
In part 2 of our project, we investigate the growth of the Solow model with human capital and natural resources. We solve the equation for growth in income per effective worker and visualize how high technological growth needs to be to compensate for the growth drag from the other parameters.

The data in table A is from the second edition book "Introducing Advanced Macroeconomics: Growth and Business Cycles" by Peter Birch Sørensen and Hans Jørgen Whitta-Jacobsen. Moreover, we have extended the dataset by combining it with data for land per worker and subsoil per worker, which we have downloaded from the World Bank data: Wealth estimates.  

The results of the project can be produced by running modelproject.ipynb.
Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the scipy package and sympy package.

Enjoy ;)
