# Welcome to CCL's NumEconCPH repository

This repository consists of three folders. One folder for each of our projects doing the semester and one folder for our exam project. In the data project, we chose data from the ATP Tennis League and made an analysis of the best male tennis players in 2015. In the model project, we chose to solve various edition of the augmented Solow model. In the exam folder, you find our best attempt to solve the exam questions.

In each of the folders, you find a ReadMe file that is specifically written for that project.
