# Examproject

Here you find our answer to the exam project. The standard packages are used for the plots and visualization, scipy are used for optimization and ipywidgets for our interactive figures. 
The exam project consists of three parts: 
1. Human capital accumulation
2. AS-AD model
3. Exchange economy

We have found inspiration from the lecture slides by Jeppe Druedahl, especially did we find the slides 'Numerical_optimization' and 'Random_Numbers_and_Simulation' useful.
